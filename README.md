I graduated with a BSc as a mathematical teacher at Hue University in 2018 and taught for one year at a high school in Vietnam from 2018 to 2019. I has been a master student in Software Engineering at Deakin University since March 2020 and will graduate in March 2022. In addition, I has been a part-time online intern at Stealth Startup since 2020 that focuses on solving a large range of real-word problems. My research covers Machine Learning and Deep Learning, focusing on Natural Language Processing and image analysis to solve real-world problems related to mission-critical applications, health informatics, math word problems, and the Internet of Things
