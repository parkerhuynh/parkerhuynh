I graduated with a BSc as a mathematical teacher at Hue University in 2018 and taught for one year at a high school in Vietnam from 2018 to 2019. Then realizing that data science was growing rapidly, I pursued a master's in Data Science at Deakin University and graduated in March 2022 with a GPA of 3.8. My research covers Machine Learning and Deep Learning, focusing on Natural Language Processing and image analysis to solve real-world problems related to mission-critical applications, health informatics, math word problems, and the Internet of Things.For my working experience, I was a part-time online intern atStealth Startup from August 2020 to November 2021, focusing on solving an extensive range of real-world problems. In addition, I was a Research Assistant at Deakin University from June 2021 to May 2022
